I created this because I could not make the docx type response file work.

~ problem one response
    - create new list
    - iterate with for loop
    - find multiples by increasing number by one and multiplying by the base
    - return new list

These are the basic logic factors I implemented. 
using a for loop to iterate through the new list I had it multiply by the base number than I increased it by one,
while increasing the index by one each loop as well. 

Problem 2

    - create new list with needed range using GetRange
    - remove same amount from 1st list using RemoveRange
    - append 2nd list to 1st list using AddRange

These simple functions will "rotate" the list over the specified amount.
